# nyc-record-mcp

An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for NYC City Record notices, powered by the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/City-Record-Online/dg92-zbpx) dataset.

The City Record is the official publication of the City of New York — procurement solicitations, contract awards, public hearings, and agency notices, all in one place.

Vibe coded with [Claude](https://claude.ai) by [BetaNYC](https://beta.nyc).

## API key

**No API key is required.** The City Record dataset is public and this server works out of the box — no signup, no token.

Optionally, you can set a free [NYC Open Data (Socrata) app token](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/profile/app_tokens) to get higher rate limits under heavy use. It is not needed for normal use. To use one, set it as the `SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN="your-app-token"
```

### `search_agency_procurement`

Search one agency's notices with combined filters: keywords, notice type, and date range. Built for procurement research — e.g. pulling an agency's historical bid solicitations and the matching awards.

Award notices include `vendor_name` and `contract_amount` (the winning bid). When a notice's description text lists further dollar figures — such as per-development line amounts in bundled NYCHA awards — they are extracted into an `amounts_in_description` array, each with surrounding context. Match a solicitation to its award via the shared `pin` field.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agency` | string | yes | — | Agency name or partial name |
| `keywords` | string[] | no | — | OR-matched against notice title, description, and PIN (RFQ/solicitation numbers work too) |
| `notice_type` | string | no | — | One of: Solicitation, Award, Intent to Award, Intent to Negotiate, Vendor List, Sale |
| `since_date` | string | no | — | Only notices published on/after this date, YYYY-MM-DD |
| `until_date` | string | no | — | Only notices published on/before this date, YYYY-MM-DD |
| `limit` | number | no | 100 | Max results (max 1000) |

```
search_agency_procurement("Housing Authority", keywords=["paint", "floor", "vinyl"], notice_type="Solicitation", since_date="2024-07-01")
search_agency_procurement("Housing Authority", keywords=["paint", "floor", "vinyl"], notice_type="Award", since_date="2024-07-01")
```

## Common workflows

### Track open RFPs before they close

```
get_open_solicitations()        → sorted by due date — soonest first
search_notices("technology")    → filter by topic to narrow scope
```

### Monitor a specific agency's procurement activity

```
get_notices_by_agency("DOITT")           → all recent notices
get_notices_by_type("Solicitation")      → open bids from any agency
```

### Research recent contract awards

```
get_notices_by_type("Award")             → recent contract awards
search_notices("cybersecurity award")    → keyword-filtered awards
```

### Pull an agency's bid history with winning amounts

```
search_agency_procurement("Housing Authority", keywords=["paint", "floor", "vinyl"],
                          notice_type="Solicitation", since_date="2024-07-01")   → the bids
search_agency_procurement("Housing Authority", keywords=["paint", "floor", "vinyl"],
                          notice_type="Award", since_date="2024-07-01")          → who won, for how much
```

### Find public comment opportunities

```
get_public_hearings()                    → hearings, meetings, comment periods
get_notices_by_date_range("2026-05-01", "2026-05-31")   → by month
```

## Data source

All data comes from the [NYC City Record Online dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/City-Record-Online/dg92-zbpx) on NYC Open Data, published by the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). The dataset is updated daily and includes notices published in the official City Record since 2015.
